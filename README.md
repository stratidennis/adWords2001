A user can select a daily budget for his Adwords campaign. The user can change the budget anytime he wants, 
including changing the budget in the same day. He can also pause the campaign at any time (the budget will be 0).

The AdWords campaign will generate costs in a random way trough-out the entire day (at most 10 times per day) based on 
the daily budget set by the end-user in the moment the cost generation is initiated, considering the following rules:

1.The cumulated daily cost can not be greater than two times of what the budget is set in the given moment
2.The cumulated cost per month can not not be greater than the sum of the maximum budget for each days within the month

To start the campaign you must input the history of the budget changes in the campaign. 
The first date that you will enter, will be the date when the campaign starts.
